User Stories
As a Pokémon enthusiast, I want an easy-to-navigate Pokémon database where I can quickly search for and view comprehensive details about any Pokémon.

Challenges
While the PokéAPI offers extensive Pokémon data, navigating its complex structure to extract specific information posed a challenge. Processing and organizing the data for a user-friendly presentation required significant effort.

As the project expanded, maintaining and modifying the codebase became increasingly challenging, especially when changes impacted multiple interconnected components. This highlighted the importance of planning and establishing a clear data flow before development begins.
